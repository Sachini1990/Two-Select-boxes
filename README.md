# Two-Select-boxes
Change a select box depending on the selection in the first select box.

Here you can populate the select boxes using the database values. then the first select box values contains the primary keys of the appropriate dataset.

The second select box should contains both the primary keys. And I have separated the two keys using a "-"
First key is select box 1's PK. Second key is select box 2's PK.
